# Portfolio
 This is my personal portfolio, where I show projects I have created or been working on. Here you can find some information about me. There are functions where you can change language from Swedish to English, An image slider to view projects. You can download a CV, view projects and use a contact form to send information.

 The website is responsive.  

 This website was made with tools such as HTML, CSS/SASS, AOS and Javascript.

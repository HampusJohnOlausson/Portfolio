# Portfolio
 This is my personal portfolio, where I show projects I have created or been working on. Here you can find some information about me. There are functions where you can change language from Swedish to English. You can download my CV, view projects and use a contact form to come in contact with me.

 The website is responsive.  

 This website was made with tools such as HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript.
